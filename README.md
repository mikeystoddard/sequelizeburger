Sequelized Burgers.

In the previous work "Burgers", I used MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and an ORM. Uses Node and MySQL to query and route data in the app, and Handlebars to generate HTML. In this sequelized version, sequelize is used instead of an ORM file to store data. 

This is a restaurant type app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat. When a user submits one of the burger's, the app will display the burger on the page -- waiting to be devoured. Each burger in the waiting area also has a Devour button. When the user clicks it, the burger will be eaten. The app will store every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.
